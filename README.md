# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

Developed a predictive machine learning model to estimate individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. Performed data preprocessing with one-hot encoding and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover key cost-driving variables. Compared Linear and Polynomial Regression models using Scikit-learn, achieving a performance improvement from R² = 0.78 to 0.86, while reducing MAE from 4284 → 2599 and RMSE from 5796 → 4570 through feature optimization and non-linear transformations.
